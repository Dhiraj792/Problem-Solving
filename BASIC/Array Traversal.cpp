/*
You are given an array arr[] that contains integers. You need to print the elements of the array in a single line with a space between them.
Note: Don't add a new line at the end.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [54, 43, 2, 1, 5]
Output: 54 43 2 1 5
Explanation: Just traverse and print the numbers.
Input: arr[] = [324, 5, 2, 2]
Output: 324 5 2 2
Explanation: Just traverse and print the numbers.

void arrayTraversal(int numbers[], int size) {
    // Code here
    for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
        cout<<numbers[i]<<" ";
    }
}
