/*
Given a number, you have to use if, else if, else conditional statements according to the following:
if number is greater than 100: Print "Big" (without quotes)
else if number is smaller than 10: Print "Small" (without quotes)
else: Print "Number" (without quotes) 

Note: Ensure that the output includes a newline after every print statement.

Examples:

Input: number = 9
Output: Small
Explanation: Here, the else if condition will work as 9 is smaller than 10.
Input: number = 101
Output: Big
Explanation: 101 is greater than 100, so our if statement works and we print Big.
Input: number = 30
Output: Number
Explanation: 30 is neither greater than 100, nor smaller than 10, so the else statement works here.
